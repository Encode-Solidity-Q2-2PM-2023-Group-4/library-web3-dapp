# library-web3-dapp

To duplicate, fork this repo, set up local repo on your machine and inside your copy run:
- `npx nest new` naming the folder `backend-nest` and selecting `npm` as package manager to create nest folder wih APIs and controllers, inside backend-nest run `npm install --save @nestjs/swagger` to get swagger
- `npm create-web3-dapp@latest` to make alchemy folder with `index.ts` - name it `frontend-alchemy`, a Boilerplates dapp with Typescript, Ethereum, Hardhat and your API key
- Make sure to delete any `.git` folders from inside either of `backend-nest` or `frontend-alchemy`
- Then, once everyone has duplicated we can push a working repo to the main branch in Encode-Solidity-...-Group-4, and we can update our GH and local branches as necessary
